    <h3>What is Conservation?</h3>
    <p>
      This is a testConservation is the protection of animals, plants, and natural resources
      to prevent them from being lost or wasted.
    </p>
    <h3>What is <span class="text-animation">Conservation Club</span>?</h3>
      <p>
      Do you want to hang out with friends and figure out ways to better protect
      our Earth? In this afterschool club, you and other environmental
      advocates from our school will become conservation leaders in our
      community by selecting and designing a project that helps protect our
      Earth.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Conservation Club is a youth-led, empowering program
      that engages students in learning and leadership around conservation
      opportunities in their schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <strong>FREE</strong> club is open to 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders 
      at the HCP-Northrop School. Interested students should return a permission form to Ms. Jaeger 
      (paper or Google form). The club will meet Thursdays from 3 - 4:15pm, from February to May 31, 2022. 
      <em>All students must be picked up by 4:15pm on meeting days. </em>

    <h3>What is a Greenhouse Gas?</h3>
    <p>
      Greenhouse gases are gases in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere that trap heat. They let sunlight pass 
      through the atmosphere, but they prevent the heat that the sunlight brings from leaving 
      the atmosphere. The main greenhouse gases are Water vapor, Carbon dioxide, Methane, Ozone, 
      Nitrous oxide, and Chlorofluorocarbons.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h3>
    <p>
      A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and 
      methane) that are generated by our actions.
    </p>
    <h3>What are Invasive Species?</h3>
    <p>
      An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological harm in a new environment where 
      it is not native. Invasive species can occur on land or in the water. They can be plants, 
      animals, fungi, and insects. Some 
      <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/index.html" target="_blank" >invasive species in Minnesota</a> 
      include zebra mussels, Eurasian watermilfoil, common buckthorn, and emerald ash borer.</p>

    <p>  
      Welcome to Conservation Club! I am the 6th grade Earth and Space Science teacher at Hiawatha 
      Academies - Northrop. The goal of this after-school program is to provide students an opportunity 
      to lead our school in improving our 
      conservation efforts as a community. When teaching our youth, I love sparking curiosity about 
      the world around us and supporting students in understanding themselves as the future leaders 
      of our next generation. My favorite subject happens to be Environmental Conservation, and I spend
      a lot of time outside, whether it's playing and coaching soccer, exploring with my pup, or hiking 
      along the Mississippi river.

      <p>A few ways that I practice conservation in my own life are composting through the city of Minneapolis, 
      buying fruits and vegetables that aren‚Äôt packaged in plastic, saying no to plastic bags (even if that 
      means awkwardly carrying a couple of items home from the store), and most important of all‚Ä¶ learning 
      and thinking about more ways to incorporate conservation into my own life.</p>

    <p>  
      Hello all! I am the 7th grade Life Science teacher at Hiawatha Academies - Northrop. If you have driven up to the school my 
      room is the one with lots of plants in the window! My goal is to bring the outside in when we are in the classroom, but I also 
      love to get students outside doing Science. Conservation is near and dear to my heart. We compost, garden, support local farms, 
      and seed save at our house. I love how many animals are attracted to my yard with all the native plants. I would love for students 
      to have that same experience here at school. I am learning new things about conservation all the time and I am excited to work with 
      students to see what new plans we can draw up together. </p>
